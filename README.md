# Kitra
This repository contains the C# source code for the Kitra Client Database Managenent Project which is a means to explore ADO.NET and native SQL operations. The project was developed in Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Comunity Edition.
Kitra is client management software for a hypothetical Blood Bank and currently allows the addition and review of client records in an MS Access database, as well as a simple blood type quick search feature. Users should configure the database connection string in Utility.cs and the data source in the Data Sources window for ADO.NET. Updates will include connectivity to Oracle SQL Server and other functionality as time permits.
